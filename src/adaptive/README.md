# Adaptive

A port of [FSharp.Data.Adaptive](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Data.Adaptive) to TypeScript to theoretically improve performance of rendering UI.
Currently WIP and not finished. Possibly not getting continued because the focus lies on other ideas and performance should be measured first and it is rather complicated and there is a new Fable TypeScript transpiler which enables transpiling F# to TypeScript directly.
